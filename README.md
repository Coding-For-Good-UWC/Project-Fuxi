# Project Fuxi: Music Therapy App for Dementia Patients 🎵🧠

## 🌟 Introduction

Welcome to **Project Fuxi**! Our goal is to improve the wellbeing of the elderly through the power of music in awakening memories. Developed by Coding for Good at UWCSEA, this React Native and Expo Go app aims to provide a user-friendly and cost-effective way for persons with dementia to enjoy and benefit from music therapy. Research shows that music awakens parts of the brain in persons with dementia, improving their quality of life. Project Fuxi is an extension of the many years of collaboration and learning with partners at Apex Harmony Lodge. This project was catalyzed by the 50th Anniversary Annual Fund Innovation Incubator.
